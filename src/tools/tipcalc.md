# IN DEVELOPMENT

The inspiration for this tool is during a group lunch with some friends. Since we all ordered food at different price points, we wanted to know the cost of each of our shares after tax and tips. There was a bit of confusion and disagreements so we ultimately split the bill evenly.

I am hoping this tool will be useful in the future if such situations ever to arise.

This calculator will be able to handle splitting the bill evenly or each person can enter the price of their orders to calculate their share of the final bill.
