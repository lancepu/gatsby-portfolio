This is my first blog posting on the new site.

Who am I? You can read more about me [**here**](/about)

The inspiration for this site is from [**Overreacted**](https://overreacted.io/) by Dan Abramov, who created [**Redux**](https://redux.js.org/), and is now working on [**React**](https://reactjs.org/)

During my coding bootcamp, we were asked to create a portfolio site that showcases our understanding of web development and present ourselves to the world (***Most importantly, hiring companies*** :wink:). Secondly, I like to share some ideas, tutorials, for others and my future self in case I need to refer back. Lastly, I want to have a centralized repository of small webapps/tools that is readly available in case I ever need to use them (*Also a good coding practice*). With all those ideas in mine, I set out to create the site you see before you.

The engine that powers this site is [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It is a React framework that is lightning fast. It has many useful plugins that makes developing professional looking sites a breeze.

Another shoutout to [**Panr**](https://github.com/panr/gatsby-starter-hello-friend), whose starter template I'm using for this site. I love the dark and light mode it provides as well as the great code structure, making my customizations a breeze.

This is actually my first attempt to write a blog, usually I just keep my ideas to myself. I am hoping I can keep up this habit and provide useful content to you **and** to my future self.

Thanks for reading!
