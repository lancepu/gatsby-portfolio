This simple game is created using React.
This is one of the projects from Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp at Columbia University when we are learning React.
The theme is adopted from the popular game **Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** on Nintendo Switch.

To play the game:

1. Click on any image to start.
2. Try not to click on any image twice to win the game.

#### Technology Stack

- Reactjs (Frontend)
- Deploy using Github pages API

#### Challenges faced

- Learning to use next generation images, such as (webp) to reduce image size and increase loading time.
- Dramatically increased Google Chrome Audit score (currently 99)
